# mossbeasts' blog skeletonizer
*This readme is currently under construction.**

Mossbeasts' blog skeletonizer is a basic framework/sandbox to make a personal blog site using github pages. I'll add more documentation about how to use it soon, but for now:

## How to post

[Here's](https://mossbeasts.github.io/2023/09/30/how-2-post-2.html) an article I wrote on my personal blog (the basis for the skeletonizer) about how to post to a Jekyll/github pages site using github's online interface. It's aimed at people who have never used github before, and who don't want to download any new programs to their computer in order to post. Feel free to ask me any questions about it in the comments of that post.

## How to customize your site's apperence (aka basic CSS for the person who's never used it before)

Coming soon!
